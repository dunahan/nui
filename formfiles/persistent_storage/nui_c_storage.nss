/// @brief  Persistent Storage formfile configuration settings
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// @note Most of the following global/default settings can be overriden on a
///     per-container basis by setting a local variable on the container
///     object as noted in the setting descriptions below.  Constants, such as
///     PS_TRUE, PS_NONE, etc. should be used in this configuration file, however,
///     actual values must be used when setting local overrides.  Those values
///     are provided below.

/// @warning This system uses player character UUIDs.  This can cause issues in
///     single-player modules if the player-character is not exported and the
///     UUID is not saved to the .bic file.

/// @brief By default, containers will be saved to a database table referenced
///     by the container object's tag.  The saved item data includes the UUID
///     and CD Key of the PC that deposited the item so the same container can
///     be used for multiple PCs.  To set a specific (unique) name to use as the
///     table name instead, set a local string called `PS_UNIQUE_ID` on the 
///     container object and set it to any unique string.

/// @brief Determines usage of the `Search` button.
///     Configuration File:
///         PS_TRUE to force players to click the `Search` button
///             before an inventory search will commence.  This is a good idea
///             for containers that you expect will have large inventories.
///         PS_FALSE to allow real-time searching as the player types
///             characters into the `Search` textbox.
///     Local Override (int): PS_FORCE_SEARCH_BUTTON

///     by two methods:  exclusive and contentious.
///     - Exclusive:  Multiple players may open the same container, but each

///         may only withdraw items they've previously deposited.
///     - Contentious:  Multiple players may open the same container.  All
///         players will see all items deposited by any player.  Any player
